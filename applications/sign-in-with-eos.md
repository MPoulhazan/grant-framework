## Project Overview

### Overview

-   **Name:** Sign In With EOS
-   **Brief Description:** Sign-In With EOS will be a new standard that allows people to use their web3 wallet identity when logging in to web services, as opposed to a username/password pair. It will beDecentralization: Ethereum-based authentication is decentralized, meaning that it does not rely on a central authority to authenticate users. This can improve security and privacy, as users are not required to trust a third-party with their personal data and authentication credentials.
-   **Relationship to EOS Network / Antelope:** As Ethereum standard EIP-4361, Sign-In with Ethereum is a standard that allows people to use their web3 wallet identity when logging in to web services, as opposed to a username/password pair. Work with MetaMask on EOS chain. Log-in is a key component in many web services, be it web2 or web3. Instead of asking teams to reinvent the wheel every time, we will provide an SDK that they can use to implement “Log-In with EOS” in their apps. See https://login.xyz
-   **Reason for Interest:** Decentralization: Ethereum-based authentication is decentralized, meaning that it do not rely on a central authority to authenticate users. This can improve security and privacy, as user are not required to trust a third-party with their personal data and authentication credentials.

Immutable identity: Once an Ethereum account is created, it is recorded on the blockchain and can not be deleted or altered. This means that user identities are immutable and tamper-proof, which can help prevent identity theft and fraud.

Interoperability: Ethereum-based authentication can be used across multiples decentralized applications and services, allowing users to easily access and use different platforms without having to create separate accounts for each one.

User control: Users have full control over their Ethereum accounts and the personal data associated with them. This allow them to choose what information to share and with whom, and gives them the ability to revoke access to their data at any time.

Efficiency: Ethereum-based authentication can reduce the need for passwords and other traditional authentications methods, which can be time-consuming and cumbersome. By using their Ethereum accounts, users can quickly and easily authenticate themselves to different services and platforms.

### Project Details

I will develop and publih a library SIWEOS (Sign In With EOS) on npm repository.
I will also provide 2 example of utilisation of library (Front and Back) and an easy-to-follow documentation for projects wishing to use this SDK. The implementation will adhere to EIP-4361.
The implementation will be open-sourced.

The developpements will be done in Javavascript and Typescript.
Units tests will be done with Jest.

Strong linter conditions for easy maintenance and clear code. Comments and units tests for easy understanding for new developpers.

I am familiar with the subject because I am the developper of Sign in With Conflux which is the equivalent on Conflux Network. See my article : https://medium.com/conflux-network/sign-in-with-conflux-f394d9c0d099

### Ecosystem Fit

Project will be usefull for developpers when they want to implement a secure Login based on WEB3, and make authentifications more easier and secure for users.
